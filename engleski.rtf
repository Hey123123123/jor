\f0\fs28 \cf0 	Since the existence of the first civilizations, people have been interested in exploring their body and health. Consequently,Indians used different types of herbs for making various remedies with curing purposes.On the other hand, ancient Greeks were dedicated to healing temples called  {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asclepius"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \cb3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0

\cf4 \ulnone However , it goes without saying that healing methods have drastically improved due to rapid technological progress.\
	In my opinion a huge improvement in healthcare system was made by digitalizing all pieces of information about patients. Therefore, accessing to data is much faster and many mistakes ,caused by unreadable doctor\'92s handwriting, were avoided.Also, nowadays doctors can make accurate diagnoses by studying patient\'92s treatment history.\
Some people say that remote patient monitoring ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://searchhealthit.techtarget.com/definition/telemedicine"}}{\fldrslt telemedicine}}) will be a breakthrough in a medical field.From my point of view this is an effective way how to get a therapy, particulary for those who live in rural areas. As a result, we will save our time and reduce costs.\

Moreover, the effectiveness of healthcare industry is rising by using innovative mobile health apps ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHealth"}}{\fldrslt mhealth}}).So, mhealth is , basically, a preventive health education.
