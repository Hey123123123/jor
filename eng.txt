I completely agree with everything that you have said.Also, I would like to mention the greenhouse effect ,which is the really important process in the nature. 
Although this effect is  a naturally occurring phenomenon, nowadays it has a negative impact on the environment due to human's activity and technological progress.By increasing the amount of gases, such as carbon dioxide ,in the atmosphere the global warming takes the step further.Consequently,  our climate changes and we face with the problems of unpredictable weather conditions. For example, global warming has caused drought in numerous countries, which may disrupt food production in certain areas.
In conclusion, even now global warming is a serious problem.But ,in my opinion we can still find a solution to correct our mistakes. Unless we do that the world will be in a great danger.
