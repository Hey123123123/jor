  Genetic engineering has made numerous changes in different fields such as medicine,agriculture etc. Consequently, this process has both, positive and negative effect on animals,food and people.
  From my perspective, nowadays, there are much more disadvantages than advantages of genetic engineering (GE). Generally, genetically modified organisms could present an ecological problem and these modified species would cause the imbalance in nature.  As a result, our planet may soon become overpopulated.
Moreover, a major disadvantage of GE is that this process can't be reversed. Therefore, scientists may discover new forms of viruses, which can cause a worldwide epidemic. Also, genetic engineering limits genetic diversity due to human's desire to be perfect.
  All in all, although I can't deny the positive sides of GE, which were mentioned in the previous post, in my opinion, we are not aware how dangerous this process is and the real consequences will barely be visible in a distant future.
